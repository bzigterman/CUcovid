This is the R code I use to make COVID-19 charts for Champaign-Urbana, Illinois

The charts for Champaign County are tweeted out daily at [@ChampaignCovid](https://twitter.com/ChampaignCovid).

Inspired by [immunityunity](https://github.com/codecreative/immunityunity) and [@ChiVaxBot](https://twitter.com/ChiVaxBot).
